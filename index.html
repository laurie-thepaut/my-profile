			<h2>My Studies</h2>
				<p>
					I studied for 5 years at ESSCA School of Management in Angers (a small city in the west of France), and I graduated with a Master in Marketing of fashion goods. 
				</p>
				<p>
					During my studies, I learned a lot about several subjects such as Marketing and Management but also Finance, Communication, Law etc. I also spent a semester in the United States 🇺🇸, in Pittsburgh.

			<h2>My Experiences</h2>
				<p>
					My first internship in fashion was at Figaret Paris, and the next one at Chloé. There, I was assisting product development managers on different subjects such as sourcing, buying, constructing the collection plan... 
				</p>
				<p>
					After graduation, I got my first job at Longchamp, the famous bag brand 👜, as a product development assistant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Six month later, I decided to totally change my career path and become Consultant in Change Management. My role was to identify problems in the organization of our client (mainly banks 💸 and insurance companies) and give them keys to resolve them.
